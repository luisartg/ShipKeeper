# Project Design Document: ShipKeeper

## Project Concept

[WORK IN PROGRESS]

### Summary

The player takes control of the main character, the ShipKeeper. A shipkeeper is a worker that lives in an abandoned dock, and gives service to ghostships, to repair them and clean them from "pests". These pests, however, are eldritch organisms that have taken the ship as their home while the ship was drifting at deep sea. Since these organisms cannot be left to live inland, you have been assigned with the mission of eliminating all pests properly.

For these purpose, a shipkeeper is provided with basic weapons/tools. However, if they prove to be efficient, they will found a way to improve their equipment.

Aside from a place to live and basic equipment, the Goverment of Wichdum Island does not provide with anything else. It is the responsability of the shipkeeper to provision themselves for survival.

## Future Ideas for monsters and encounters
| Monster | Description |
|-----------|----------|
|Planted Head| A human head whose neck is rooted to the floor. Will sleep on candle light. Other lights wake them up and attack the player|
|Crying Ghost| A passive ghost which keeps crying while staying in a specific place. It dissapears and appears in other random place if is seen by the player character directly for 2 seconds. Will only be released with a ritual. While they are in a room, the room will slowly get damaged.|
|Fishrats| Common pest, easy too kill, but usually make nests which keeps producing the fishrats. They are an amalgam of fish head and rat body.|
|Octocrab| An octorpus-like creature using a crab shell as defense.|
|Watermites|Watermites rot the wood of the ship, they can nest anywhere and if released, they will slowly damage the room. If left alive, after a while they will infect other rooms.|
|Meat lumps| Lumps of human flesh mashed together. Crawl slowly but somehow sturdy to kill. Chopping them is best way to kill them for good.|
|Sea spider| Little white spider that creates resistant webs. They usually don't attack the player but their webs can cause trouble. If Watermites reach a room with Sea Spiders, the sea spiders will eat the watermites, but this will make them grow and will be able to attack the player in their new form|
