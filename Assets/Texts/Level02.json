                "Now, I got something special for you. We got another ship, and initial reports say that this one is parasited by 'blobs'...",
                "No numbers, no locations. Well, so much for a report, right? What a waste of paper I tell ya!",
                "But don't worry. A Shipkeeper never works without their trusty axe. We also had a shotgun, but that thing broke a few days ago.",
                "It's gonna take a while to repair. So don't ask for it for the time being.",
                "On the good news, this pest that we call 'blob' never moves. That, however, does not make it less dangerous.",
                "Nasty pests I tell you! They all have these nasty spear-like tentacles. Careful with those things, -three hits- of that and you will be done.",
                "To kill blobs just hit them with you axe by pressing [LMB].",
                "Oh! And if you want to take aim while moving, just keep [RMB] pressed.",
                "All right kid... Good luck in there."

                "Well, that's one thing I love of this job. Nothin' like a good ol' wood smashing, am I right?",
                "Time to practice that axe swing kid, go nuts!"
